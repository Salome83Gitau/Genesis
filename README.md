## Overview

The Sheridan Preparatory School website is designed to provide a modern and engaging digital presence for a fictional school.

## Why Sheridan Preparatory School?

For this project, I chose to create a website for an existing school named Sheridan Preparatory School. The purpose was to demonstrate my front-end web development and UI/UX design skills by building a professional, functional, and responsive school website. The design and content were imagined to represent a standard school environment, serving as a creative canvas to showcase a variety of modern web development techniques.
